# imamopravoznati-utilities

This is IPZ update workflow with two Python scripts by saifullahalam:

1. **TJV parser** (on Morph.io https://morph.io/SelectSoft/blue_gene, see code in [tjv-parser-v1.zip](https://github.com/codeforcroatia/imamopravoznati-utilities/blob/master/tjv-parser-v1.zip))
2. **IPZ updater** (that is run on localhost, see code in [ipz-updater-v1.zip](https://github.com/codeforcroatia/imamopravoznati-utilities/blob/master/ipz-updater-v1.zip)) 

## Installation instructions

1. **TJV parser** runs directly on Morph.io

2. **IPZ updater** can be executed locally on machine:

I run Python version 3.7.3. You also have to add pandas by using pip or conda like:

`pip install pandas` (If you are using pip)

OR

`conda install pandas` (If you are using Conda)

and you also have to change `authority-export.csv` file path according to your machine.
